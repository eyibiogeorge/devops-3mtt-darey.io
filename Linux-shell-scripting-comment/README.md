# Linux Shell Scripting Comments

### What are Comment?

```Comments are lines in your code that are ignore by the interpreter. In Bash scripts, comments help document the purpose and logic of your code, making it easier for others (and yourself) to follow and understand the script's functionality.```

### Single-Line Comments

Single-line comments in Bash start with the `#` symbol. Anything following this symbol on the same line is treated as a comment and is not executed.
