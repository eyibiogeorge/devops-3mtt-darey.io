### Implementing Error Handling

Develop strategies to handle error effectively. Some key steps to think through and implement error handling:

- ***Identify Potential Errors:*** Begin by identifying potential sources of errors in your script, such as user input validation, command execution, or file operations. Anticipate scenarios where errors may occur and how the could impact script execution.

- ***Use Conditional Statements:*** Utilise conditional statements such as `if, elif, else` to check for error conditions and respond accordingly. Evaluate the exit status `$?` of commands to determin whether they executed successfully or encountered error.

- ***Provide informative Messages:*** When errors occur, provide descriptive error messages that clearly indicate what went wrong and how users can resolve the issue.
